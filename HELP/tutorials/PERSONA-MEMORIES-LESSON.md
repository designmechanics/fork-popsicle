## What Are Persona Memories?

🧠 **Think of persona memories as your AI's personal notebook about you**:
- **Regular conversations** = The AI forgets after the chat ends
- **Persona memories** = The AI remembers permanently and uses this knowledge in future conversations
- Each memory has context, importance levels, and different types
- Memories help your persona give better, more personalized responses over time

### Why Manage Memories?

🎯 **Memory management makes your AI assistants**:
- **More personal**: Remember your preferences and style

## Troubleshooting Memory Issues

### "I can't find a specific memory"

🔧 **Try these search strategies**:
1. Search with different keywords or phrases
2. Lower the threshold (try 0.2 instead of 0.3)
3. Search by memory type if you remember the category
4. Use the hybrid search for AI-powered understanding

### "My persona isn't using memories in conversations"

🔧 **Check these**:
1. Verify memories were added successfully (check for confirmation)
2. Ensure memory importance is appropriate (0.5+ for important info)
3. Test with direct questions about the memory content
4. Check if conversation context matches memory content

### "Too many low-quality memories"

🔧 **Clean up with**:
1. Use cleanup_persona_memories with appropriate time ranges
2. Search for low-importance memories and remove manually
3. Increase importance thresholds for future memories
4. Focus on adding fewer, higher-quality memories

### "Memory search returns too many irrelevant results"

🔧 **Refine your searches**:
1. Increase similarity threshold (try 0.5-0.7)
2. Use more specific search terms
3. Filter by memory type
4. Use hybrid search for better AI understanding

### "Persona seems to have forgotten old information"

🔧 **Check these possibilities**:
1. Memory may have been cleaned up automatically (check cleanup settings)
2. Information might be stored with low importance (search with lower threshold)
3. Memory decay time might be too short (check persona settings)
4. Search for the information using different keywords

### "Memory tools are giving errors"

🔧 **Common solutions**:
1. Check that persona ID/name is spelled correctly
2. Ensure memory content isn't too long (max 10,000 characters)
3. Verify memory IDs are valid if using get_full_memory
4. Try again if you get temporary connection errors

### "Knowledge graph seems empty or disconnected"

🔧 **Build better connections**:
1. Add more related memories about similar topics
2. Use consistent terminology across memories
3. Increase memory importance for key concepts
4. Let the system process relationships over time (24-48 hours)
