# Zero-Vector-3 Setup Summary

## ‚úÖ What We've Fixed

### 1. Original Issue: OPENAI_API_KEY Configuration Error
- **Problem:** The `npm run setup:infrastructure` command was failing because it couldn't find the OPENAI_API_KEY
- **Root Cause:** The zero-vector-3 project was looking for its own `.env` file, but the API key was stored in the zero-vector project
- **Solution:** Created a dedicated `.env` file for zero-vector-3 with all necessary configuration

### 2. PostgreSQL Setup Required
- **Problem:** The infrastructure setup requires PostgreSQL but it wasn't installed
- **Solution:** Downloaded PostgreSQL 16.9 installer and created automated setup scripts

## üìÅ Files Created/Modified

### New Files:
1. **`zero-vector-3/server/.env`** - Environment configuration with all required variables
2. **`zero-vector-3/server/POSTGRESQL_SETUP_GUIDE.md`** - Step-by-step PostgreSQL installation guide
3. **`zero-vector-3/server/scripts/setup-database.js`** - Automated database setup script
4. **`zero-vector-3/server/SETUP_SUMMARY.md`** - This summary document

### Modified Files:
1. **`zero-vector-3/server/package.json`** - Added `setup:postgres` script command

## üöÄ Next Steps (In Order)

### Step 1: Install PostgreSQL
1. Run the downloaded PostgreSQL installer (`postgresql-16.9-1-windows-x64.exe`)
2. Follow the installation guide in `POSTGRESQL_SETUP_GUIDE.md`
3. Remember the postgres superuser password you set during installation

### Step 2: Setup Database and User
Run the automated database setup script:
```cmd
cd zero-vector-3/server
npm run setup:postgres
```

This script will:
- Create the `zerovector3` database
- Create the `zerovector` user with proper permissions
- Test the connection
- Automatically update the `.env` file with your credentials

### Step 3: Run Infrastructure Setup
After the database is configured:
```cmd
npm run setup:infrastructure
```

This should now work without the original OPENAI_API_KEY error!

## üîß Current Configuration

### Environment Variables Set:
- ‚úÖ `OPENAI_API_KEY` - Your OpenAI API key (copied from zero-vector project)
- ‚úÖ `JWT_SECRET` - JWT signing secret
- ‚úÖ `API_KEY_SECRET` - API key secret
- ‚è≥ `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` - Will be set by setup script
- ‚úÖ All other required variables with sensible defaults

### Services Configuration:
- **Port:** 3001 (to avoid conflicts with original zero-vector on 3000)
- **PostgreSQL:** localhost:5432, database: zerovector3, user: zerovector
- **Redis:** localhost:6379 (will need to be installed separately if needed)
- **LangGraph:** Using memory backend initially (can upgrade to PostgreSQL later)

## üéØ What This Enables

Once setup is complete, you'll have:
- ‚úÖ **LangGraph agent orchestration**
- ‚úÖ **High-performance caching** (when Redis is added)
- ‚úÖ **Human-in-the-loop workflows**
- ‚úÖ **Hybrid vector-graph search**
- ‚úÖ **Performance monitoring**
- ‚úÖ **Persistent checkpointing** (PostgreSQL-backed)

## üîç Troubleshooting

### If PostgreSQL installation fails:
- Make sure you're running the installer as Administrator
- Check Windows Defender/antivirus isn't blocking the installation
- Ensure you have enough disk space (PostgreSQL needs ~200MB)

### If database setup script fails:
- Verify PostgreSQL service is running (Windows Services ‚Üí postgresql-x64-16)
- Check the postgres superuser password is correct
- Ensure port 5432 isn't blocked by firewall

### If infrastructure setup still fails:
- Check the updated `.env` file has correct credentials
- Verify you can connect to PostgreSQL manually using pgAdmin
- Look at the error logs in `zero-vector-3/server/logs/`

## üìû Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the specific error message in the console
2. Review the troubleshooting sections in `POSTGRESQL_SETUP_GUIDE.md`
3. Verify all services are running (PostgreSQL, and optionally Redis)
4. Check the `.env` file has been updated with correct credentials

The original OPENAI_API_KEY issue is now resolved - the remaining setup is just getting the database infrastructure in place!
